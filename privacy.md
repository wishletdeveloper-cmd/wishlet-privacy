# Wishlet Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** January 2025

## What we collect

- **Account data:** Email address, phone number (if you sign in with phone), display name, and username. We use this to create and manage your account and to communicate with you (e.g. email verification, password reset).
- **Usage and content:** Purchases and wishlist items you add, and content you share with friends. We use this to provide the app's features (feed, wishlists, sharing).
- **Device and logs:** We may store your auth token on your device and log errors or usage on our servers to run and improve the service.

## How we use it

- To provide and secure the Wishlet service (auth, feed, wishlists, friends).
- To send you transactional messages (e.g. email verification, password reset).
- To improve the app and fix issues (e.g. crash or error logs).

We do not sell your personal information.

## Data sharing

- We may use service providers (e.g. hosting, email delivery) that process data on our behalf under strict agreements.
- If you use bank-linking features, the relevant provider (e.g. Plaid) has its own privacy policy; we encourage you to read it.

## Your rights

You can request access, correction, or deletion of your data by contacting us (see Contact below). You can delete your account from the app or by contacting us.

## Security

We use industry-standard measures (e.g. HTTPS, secure auth) to protect your data. Passwords are hashed and not stored in plain text.

## Changes

We may update this policy; we will post the new version and, where required, notify you.

## 1. Acceptance

By using Wishlet ("the App"), you agree to these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 2. Service

Wishlet lets you share wishlists and purchases with friends. We provide the App "as is" and may change or discontinue features with reasonable notice where possible.

## 3. Account

You must provide accurate information and keep your account secure. You are responsible for activity under your account.

## 4. Acceptable use

You will not use the App to:

- Violate any law or others' rights.
- Post harmful, misleading, or offensive content.
- Attempt to gain unauthorized access to the App or others' accounts or data.
- Use the App for fraud or to harm others.

We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms.

## 5. Your content

You keep ownership of content you post. You grant us the rights needed to operate the App (e.g. storing, displaying, and sharing your content as you choose in the App).

## 6. Privacy

Our [Privacy Policy](../privacy/) explains how we collect and use data. By using the App you consent to that processing.

## 7. Disclaimers

The App is provided "as is." We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free service. We are not responsible for content posted by users or for any decisions you make based on the App (e.g. purchases).

## 8. Limitation of liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, we are not liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages, or for loss of data or profits, arising from your use of the App.

We may update these Terms. Continued use of the App after changes means you accept the new Terms. We will post the updated Terms in the App or on our website.
